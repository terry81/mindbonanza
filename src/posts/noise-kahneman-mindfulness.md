---

In 2021, Daniel Kahneman—along with co-authors Olivier Sibony and Cass Sunstein—published what would be his final major work: *Noise: A Flaw in Human Judgment*. While *Thinking, Fast and Slow* explored bias (systematic errors that push judgments in predictable directions), *Noise* tackles something equally important but far less understood: the random variability in our judgments.

The insight is both simple and disturbing: wherever there is judgment, there is noise. And there's far more of it than we imagine.

For mindfulness practitioners, this book offers profound insights into the nature of mind and the importance of present-moment awareness in making better decisions.

## What Is Noise?

Imagine two judges sentencing similar defendants for similar crimes. If both judges are too harsh, that's bias—a systematic error. But if one judge gives five years while another gives fifteen for essentially the same case, that's noise—unwanted variability.

Kahneman and his colleagues define noise as **the variability in judgments that should be identical**. It's the scatter around the target, independent of where the target is.

Consider these findings from the book:

- **Criminal sentencing:** Different judges give wildly different sentences for identical cases. One study found the average difference between judges was 3.5 years—for the same crime.
- **Medical diagnoses:** Doctors examining the same X-rays, pathologists analyzing the same biopsies, psychiatrists evaluating the same patients often reach different conclusions.
- **Insurance underwriting:** Professionals assessing the same case can vary by 55% or more in their premium estimates.
- **Asylum decisions:** Whether a refugee receives asylum depends significantly on which judge reviews the case, what time of day it's reviewed, and even the weather.

Most disturbing: **the same person making the same judgment at different times will often reach different conclusions**. This is called "occasion noise"—the variability within a single individual across occasions.

## The Hidden Scandal

Kahneman calls noise a "hidden scandal" because organizations rarely measure it. They assume that trained professionals making judgments will reach similar conclusions. They're wrong.

When noise is measured, the results are shocking. Yet it remains invisible because:

1. **We don't compare judgments systematically.** Each case is handled individually, so we never see the variation.
2. **We explain away differences.** When judges disagree, we assume they saw something different, not that judgment itself is unreliable.
3. **We prefer stories to statistics.** Acknowledging noise means accepting that outcomes depend partly on randomness—an uncomfortable truth.

The implications are profound. People's fates—whether they go to prison, receive medical treatment, get approved for loans, or win asylum—depend significantly on which professional happens to review their case, and even on that professional's mood that day.

## Why This Matters for Mindfulness

If *Thinking, Fast and Slow* showed us that our minds are biased, *Noise* reveals something equally troubling: our minds are inconsistent. We don't just systematically err in one direction; we scatter randomly around, changing our judgments based on factors we're not even aware of.

This connects directly to mindfulness in several ways:

### 1. The Illusion of Stable Self

We like to believe we have consistent values, stable preferences, and reliable judgment. Noise research demolishes this illusion. The same person, facing the same decision, will often judge differently depending on:

- Time of day
- Hunger or fatigue
- Recent experiences
- Mood
- Weather
- What they just read or watched

Mindfulness has always taught that the self is more fluid than we believe—that "I" am not a fixed entity but a constantly shifting process. Noise research provides empirical confirmation: our judgments, preferences, and decisions are far less stable than we imagine.

### 2. The Importance of Present-Moment Awareness

If our judgments vary based on factors we're not aware of, then awareness itself becomes crucial. Mindfulness cultivates exactly this: the ability to notice our current state, to recognize when we're tired, irritable, anxious, or influenced by recent events.

This awareness doesn't eliminate noise, but it creates the possibility of accounting for it. "I notice I'm hungry and frustrated right now—maybe I should wait before making this decision."

### 3. The Value of Slowing Down

Noise often enters through System 1—our fast, automatic, intuitive processing. When we make quick judgments, we're more susceptible to whatever internal and external factors happen to be present.

Mindfulness practices that slow us down—that create space between stimulus and response—offer protection against noise. By engaging System 2 more deliberately, we can at least attempt more consistent reasoning.

## Sources of Noise

Kahneman and colleagues identify several types of noise:

### Level Noise

Some judges are consistently harsh, others consistently lenient. Some doctors are quick to diagnose, others conservative. This creates systematic variation between individuals.

**Mindfulness connection:** We each have characteristic patterns—our "set point" for judgments in various domains. Mindfulness helps us become aware of our tendencies. Am I generally optimistic or pessimistic in my assessments? Quick to trust or slow? Knowing our patterns is the first step to accounting for them.

### Pattern Noise

Different people respond differently to specific features of cases. One judge might be particularly harsh on drug offenses but lenient on white-collar crime. Another might show the opposite pattern.

**Mindfulness connection:** We all have triggers—specific situations, types of people, or topics that provoke stronger reactions. Mindfulness helps identify these patterns: "I notice I react strongly when..." Awareness of our idiosyncratic responses allows us to question whether those reactions are appropriate.

### Occasion Noise

The same person judges the same case differently at different times. This is perhaps the most troubling finding because it reveals the unreliability within individuals, not just between them.

**Mindfulness connection:** Our internal state fluctuates constantly. Mindfulness makes us aware of these fluctuations—the rising and falling of moods, energy, and attention throughout the day. This awareness is protective: we can learn when we're in good states for judgment and when we should defer.

## The Noise Audit

One of the book's practical contributions is the concept of a "noise audit"—systematically measuring variability in judgments within an organization. The process is simple:

1. Have multiple people judge the same cases independently
2. Compare their judgments
3. Quantify the variation

Organizations that conduct noise audits are invariably shocked by the results. The variation is always larger than expected.

**Mindfulness parallel:** We can conduct our own internal noise audits. Try this: record your judgments about recurring situations over time. How do you rate your mood each morning? How do you assess the same colleague's performance week to week? How consistent are your estimates of how long tasks will take?

You'll likely find more variation than you expected. This isn't failure—it's the nature of mind. But awareness of this variation is the beginning of wisdom.

## What Causes Occasion Noise?

The book identifies numerous factors that influence our moment-to-moment judgments:

### Mood and Emotion

Good moods lead to more favorable judgments, bad moods to harsher ones. We're more creative when happy, more critical when sad. We take greater risks when excited, become more conservative when anxious.

**Mindfulness practice:** Regular emotional check-ins. Before important judgments, pause and notice: What's my emotional state right now? Is this state appropriate for the decision I'm about to make?

### Cognitive Depletion

Willpower and concentration deplete over time. Studies show judges make harsher decisions later in the day and just before lunch—when they're tired and hungry.

**Mindfulness practice:** Know your cognitive rhythms. Schedule important decisions for when you're fresh. Practice recognizing depletion: "I've been concentrating hard for hours—this might not be the best time for this decision."

### Recent Information

What we've just seen, read, or experienced heavily influences subsequent judgments. This is "priming"—recent stimuli activate related concepts that then color our thinking.

**Mindfulness practice:** Notice what you've been consuming. If you've just read negative news, watched a disturbing video, or had a difficult conversation, recognize that your subsequent judgments may be colored by that experience.

### Anchoring

The first piece of information we encounter anchors subsequent judgments. In group settings, whoever speaks first often anchors the entire discussion.

**Mindfulness practice:** Notice anchors. When you form an initial impression, recognize it as an anchor that may or may not be appropriate. In groups, be aware of how earlier speakers constrain later thinking.

### Context Effects

Judgments are relative, not absolute. A moderately good wine tastes better after a bad one. A job candidate seems stronger after interviewing a weak one. Our assessments depend on what we're comparing to.

**Mindfulness practice:** Recognize the relativity of perception. Ask: "Am I judging this on its merits, or relative to something I recently experienced?"

## Reducing Noise: Strategies from the Book

Kahneman and colleagues offer several strategies for reducing noise in organizations and individuals:

### 1. Decision Hygiene

Just as physical hygiene prevents disease without targeting specific pathogens, "decision hygiene" reduces error without knowing which specific errors you're preventing.

Key practices:
- **Decompose judgments** into independent components
- **Use structured processes** rather than holistic impressions
- **Delay intuition** until after systematic analysis
- **Aggregate independent judgments** from multiple people

**Mindfulness connection:** These practices share a common element: slowing down and making implicit processes explicit. This is what mindfulness does—it makes visible what usually operates invisibly.

### 2. Rules and Algorithms

Algorithms are noise-free. They give the same output for the same input every time. Even simple rules often outperform expert judgment because they eliminate variability.

This doesn't mean algorithms are always right—they can be biased. But they're consistent. And sometimes consistency is more important than we realize.

**Mindfulness connection:** Mindfulness helps us recognize when we're suited to judge and when we should defer to rules or systems. It cultivates the humility to acknowledge that our intuitions aren't always trustworthy.

### 3. Structured Decision-Making

Rather than making holistic judgments, break decisions into components. Judge each component separately before integrating them. This reduces the noise that comes from overall impressions.

**Mindfulness practice:** Apply this to personal decisions. Rather than asking "Is this a good job offer?", separately evaluate: compensation, growth potential, work-life balance, cultural fit, commute, etc. Rate each independently before integrating.

### 4. Reference Classes

Instead of treating each case as unique, compare it to similar cases. "What usually happens with cases like this?" This anchors judgment in data rather than individual impression.

**Mindfulness practice:** Before predicting outcomes, ask: "What's my reference class? What usually happens in situations like this?" This creates healthy skepticism about our unique insights.

## The Wisdom of Recognizing Noise

There's something deeply mindful about acknowledging noise. It requires:

**Humility:** Accepting that our judgments are less reliable than we believe.

**Presence:** Recognizing that our current state influences our conclusions.

**Non-attachment:** Holding our opinions more lightly, knowing they might be different tomorrow.

**Equanimity:** Accepting uncertainty without demanding false precision.

The Buddha taught that clinging to fixed views causes suffering. Noise research shows that our views are far less fixed than we imagine—they shift with our moods, energy levels, and recent experiences. Recognizing this impermanence in our own minds can actually be liberating.

## Practical Applications for Daily Life

### Before Important Decisions

- **Check your state:** Am I tired, hungry, stressed, or emotionally activated?
- **Consider timing:** Is this the best time for this decision?
- **Seek independence:** Get input from others before sharing your view to avoid anchoring them.
- **Decompose the judgment:** Break complex decisions into components.
- **Reference the base rate:** What usually happens in cases like this?

### For Recurring Judgments

- **Create consistency aids:** Checklists, criteria, rating scales.
- **Track your judgments:** Notice patterns in when you judge harshly vs. leniently.
- **Build in delays:** Sleep on important decisions when possible.
- **Seek feedback:** Find out how your judgments turned out; calibrate accordingly.

### For Self-Understanding

- **Notice your variability:** Your preferences, moods, and judgments fluctuate more than you think.
- **Don't over-identify with current states:** How you feel now isn't how you'll always feel.
- **Practice equanimity with inconsistency:** Variability isn't failure; it's human nature.

## Conclusion: The Mindful Response to Noise

*Noise* completes the picture that *Thinking, Fast and Slow* began. Together, the books reveal that our judgments are both biased (systematically wrong) and noisy (inconsistently wrong). Our minds are neither accurate nor reliable.

This could be depressing. But for mindfulness practitioners, it's actually liberating. It confirms what contemplative traditions have long taught:

- The self is not as solid as it appears
- Our thoughts and judgments are not gospel truth
- Awareness itself is the beginning of wisdom
- Holding views lightly is healthier than grasping them tightly

Daniel Kahneman spent his career revealing the flaws in human judgment. But he wasn't a pessimist. He believed that by understanding our limitations, we could design better systems, make better decisions, and treat each other more fairly.

Mindfulness offers something similar: not perfection, but awareness. Not elimination of error, but a wiser relationship to our inevitably flawed minds.

In the end, both Kahneman's science and contemplative wisdom arrive at the same place: **know thyself**—including the noise.
