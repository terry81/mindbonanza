---

You sit down to meditate after lunch. Within five minutes, your mind is racing. Thoughts cascade uncontrollably. Your body feels restless, agitated. Focus is impossible. You blame yourself: "I'm bad at meditation. My mind is too active. I can't do this."

But what if the problem isn't your mind—it's what you fed it?

That seemingly innocent dessert, the sweetened coffee, the "healthy" granola bar—they've triggered a neurochemical cascade that makes mindfulness nearly impossible. Your blood sugar has spiked, insulin is flooding your system, and your brain is now caught in a cycle that directly opposes the calm, steady awareness meditation requires.

The relationship between sugar and mindfulness is more profound than most people realize. Sugar doesn't just affect your body—it hijacks the very mechanisms that support presence, awareness, and emotional regulation. Understanding this connection can transform both your meditation practice and your daily life.

This isn't about demonizing sugar or adopting extreme restrictions. It's about understanding how what you eat affects your capacity for awareness, and making informed choices that support the inner clarity you're cultivating.

## The neuroscience: How sugar affects the brain

To understand sugar's impact on mindfulness, we need to understand what happens in your brain when you consume it.

### **The glucose spike and crash cycle**

When you eat sugar (or refined carbohydrates that quickly convert to sugar):

**1. Blood sugar spikes rapidly**
- Glucose floods the bloodstream
- The brain gets a sudden surge of fuel
- You may feel energized, alert, even euphoric

**2. Insulin rushes in**
- The pancreas releases insulin to manage the spike
- Insulin drives glucose into cells rapidly
- Often overshoots, creating a crash

**3. Blood sugar drops (reactive hypoglycemia)**
- Brain senses insufficient fuel
- Stress hormones (cortisol, adrenaline) release
- You feel anxious, irritable, unfocused, craving more sugar

**4. The craving cycle begins**
- Brain demands quick energy
- You reach for more sugar
- The cycle repeats

### **Why this matters for mindfulness**

Each phase of this cycle directly undermines awareness:

**During the spike:**
- Mental restlessness and racing thoughts
- Difficulty settling into meditation
- Scattered attention and distractibility
- Hyperactivity that feels like energy but isn't sustainable

**During the crash:**
- Anxiety and irritability
- Difficulty concentrating
- Emotional reactivity
- Brain fog and confusion
- Strong cravings that hijack attention

**Stable blood sugar, by contrast:**
- Steady energy without peaks and crashes
- Calm, clear mental state
- Easier access to focus and presence
- Emotional stability
- Freedom from constant food thoughts

### **The dopamine hijack**

Sugar activates the brain's reward system similarly to addictive drugs:

**What happens:**
- Sugar consumption triggers dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens (reward center)
- This creates a pleasure response disproportionate to the nutritional value
- Over time, the brain downregulates dopamine receptors (builds tolerance)
- You need more sugar to get the same effect
- Natural pleasures (conversation, nature, meditation) become less rewarding

**The mindfulness connection:**

Mindfulness cultivates awareness of subtle joys—a breath, a sensation, a moment of stillness. But when your dopamine system is hijacked by supernormal stimuli like sugar, these subtle experiences can't compete. You've trained your brain to need intense hits of pleasure.

**Result:** Meditation feels boring. Presence feels flat. You reach for stimulation—and often, that means sugar.

### **Inflammation and the gut-brain axis**

High sugar consumption creates systemic inflammation, including in the brain:

**The process:**
- Sugar feeds harmful gut bacteria and yeast
- Creates intestinal permeability ("leaky gut")
- Inflammatory molecules enter bloodstream
- Cross blood-brain barrier
- Cause neuroinflammation

**Impact on mindfulness:**
- Brain fog and cognitive cloudiness
- Mood instability (inflammation affects neurotransmitter production)
- Increased anxiety and depression
- Difficulty with emotional regulation
- Reduced neuroplasticity (brain's ability to change and adapt)

**The gut produces 90% of the body's serotonin.** Sugar-driven gut dysbiosis directly impacts your mood, anxiety levels, and capacity for calm awareness.

### **The stress hormone connection**

Sugar consumption and stress create a vicious cycle:

**Sugar → Stress:**
- Blood sugar crashes trigger cortisol release
- Chronic sugar consumption creates chronic stress physiology
- Elevated cortisol shrinks the hippocampus (memory and emotional regulation)
- Stress makes you crave sugar for quick energy

**Stress → Sugar:**
- Stress depletes willpower and self-regulation
- Cortisol drives sugar cravings
- You're more likely to reach for comfort foods
- The cycle continues

**Mindfulness connection:** Meditation requires a parasympathetic (rest-and-digest) state. Sugar keeps you in sympathetic (fight-or-flight) mode. These are incompatible.

## How sugar undermines specific mindfulness practices

Let's get practical. Here's how sugar affects different aspects of mindfulness:

### **1. Meditation and concentration**

**What sugar does:**
- Creates mental restlessness that makes sitting difficult
- Generates intrusive thoughts about food and cravings
- Causes physical discomfort (jitteriness, digestive issues)
- Makes it nearly impossible to settle into deep states

**What meditators notice:**
- "My mind won't stop racing"
- "I can't sit still"
- "I keep thinking about snacks"
- "I feel anxious for no reason"

**Often, it's not your mind—it's your blood sugar.**

### **2. Emotional regulation**

Mindfulness helps you observe emotions without being overwhelmed by them. Sugar makes this nearly impossible:

**Sugar's impact:**
- Amplifies emotional reactivity
- Makes small frustrations feel like crises
- Reduces ability to pause between stimulus and response
- Creates mood swings that feel like "who you are" but are actually blood chemistry

**Example:**
- Without sugar spike/crash: "I'm noticing irritation arising. Interesting. It will pass."
- With sugar spike/crash: "I HATE EVERYTHING AND EVERYONE!" (No space for observation)

### **3. Present-moment awareness**

Sugar constantly pulls you out of the present:

**How:**
- Physical discomfort demands attention (stomach pain, energy crashes, headaches)
- Cravings hijack mental space ("What's in the kitchen? Should I have something?")
- Post-consumption regret occupies thoughts ("Why did I eat that? I have no willpower.")
- Planning for next fix ("I'll stop after this one. Tomorrow I'll do better.")

**You're literally less present** when your system is managing sugar's effects.

### **4. Body awareness**

Mindfulness includes sensitivity to body sensations. Sugar dulls this:

**Effects:**
- Numbs authentic body signals (hunger, satiety, energy levels)
- Creates artificial sensations (sugar high, crash) that mask real needs
- Disconnects you from what your body actually requires
- Makes it harder to notice subtle sensations in meditation

**You learn to override your body's wisdom** in favor of craving signals.

### **5. Impulse control and conscious choice**

Mindfulness is about responding rather than reacting. Sugar undermines this:

**How sugar affects self-regulation:**
- Depletes prefrontal cortex function (executive control)
- Strengthens automatic habit loops
- Makes delayed gratification nearly impossible during crashes
- Creates tunnel vision focused on getting more sugar

**Result:** You know you "shouldn't," but you do it anyway. Not because you lack willpower, but because sugar has temporarily disabled the brain regions responsible for conscious choice.

## The hidden sugars sabotaging your practice

You might think you don't eat much sugar. But it's hiding everywhere:

### **Obvious sources:**
- Candy, cookies, cakes, ice cream
- Soda and sweetened beverages
- Desserts and pastries

### **Hidden sources that surprise people:**

**"Healthy" foods:**
- Flavored yogurt (often 20-30g sugar per serving)
- Granola and granola bars
- Fruit juice (as much sugar as soda, without the fiber)
- Smoothies (blending destroys fiber, spikes blood sugar)
- Dried fruit (concentrated sugar bombs)
- Most breakfast cereals (even "whole grain" varieties)

**Savory foods:**
- Pasta sauce (3-12g per serving)
- Salad dressings
- Bread (including "whole wheat")
- Crackers and chips
- Condiments (ketchup, BBQ sauce)
- Processed meats

**Beverages:**
- Coffee drinks (lattes, mochas, flavored coffees)
- Sports and energy drinks
- Flavored water
- Iced tea
- Alcohol (converts to sugar, disrupts blood sugar regulation)

**Restaurant and takeout:**
- Most sauces and marinades contain sugar
- Even savory dishes often include added sugar for palatability
- Portion sizes amplify the effect

### **Reading labels:**

Sugar hides under many names:
- Anything ending in "-ose": glucose, fructose, sucrose, maltose, dextrose
- Syrups: corn syrup, high-fructose corn syrup, maple syrup, agave
- Natural sugars: honey, molasses, fruit juice concentrate
- Sneaky terms: evaporated cane juice, brown rice syrup, malt

**Guideline:** WHO recommends less than 25g (6 teaspoons) of added sugar per day. Many people consume 75-100g or more.

---

## The mindful eating experiment: Observing sugar's effects

The best way to understand sugar's impact is direct observation:

### **The 7-day sugar awareness practice**

This isn't about restriction yet—just observation.

**Days 1-3: Track without changing**
1. **Log everything you eat and drink** (use an app or notebook)
2. **Note sugar content** (read labels, estimate if eating out)
3. **Journal your mental/emotional state** three times daily:
   - Morning: Rate energy, mood, focus (1-10 scale)
   - Afternoon: Same
   - Evening: Same, plus meditation quality if you practice

4. **Notice correlations:**
   - How do you feel 30-60 minutes after sugar consumption?
   - What about 2-3 hours later?
   - How's your meditation on high-sugar days vs. lower-sugar days?

**Days 4-7: Reduce by half**
1. **Cut sugar intake by 50%** (not completely—we're observing, not suffering)
2. **Continue tracking** energy, mood, focus, meditation quality
3. **Notice differences:**
   - Is concentration easier?
   - Are cravings stronger or weaker?
   - How's your emotional stability?
   - What about meditation depth?

**Day 8: Reflect and journal**
- What did you notice?
- Which changes were hardest?
- What surprised you?
- What relationship exists between your sugar intake and mindfulness capacity?

### **The meditation comparison practice**

Do this over two separate days:

**Day 1: High-sugar day**
- Eat a high-sugar meal (dessert, sweetened beverages, refined carbs)
- Wait 30 minutes
- Meditate for 20 minutes
- Journal: quality of focus, thoughts, restlessness, depth

**Day 2: Low-sugar day**
- Eat a balanced meal (protein, healthy fats, complex carbs, fiber)
- Wait 30 minutes
- Meditate for 20 minutes
- Journal: compare to Day 1

**What most people notice:**
- Dramatically different meditation quality
- Clearer mind on low-sugar day
- Easier to settle and deepen
- More emotional stability

**This direct experience is more convincing than any article.**

## Practical strategies: Supporting mindfulness through diet

How do you stabilize blood sugar to support meditation and awareness?

### **Strategy 1: Protein and fat with every meal**

**Why it works:**
- Slows glucose absorption
- Provides steady energy
- Increases satiety
- Stabilizes mood

**Practical application:**
- Breakfast: Eggs with vegetables, not cereal
- Snacks: Nuts, cheese, vegetables with hummus
- Meals: Balance plate with protein, healthy fats, vegetables

### **Strategy 2: Choose complex carbohydrates**

**Not all carbs are equal:**

**Refined carbs (act like sugar):**
- White bread, pasta, rice
- Most cereals
- Crackers, pretzels
- Baked goods

**Complex carbs (slower digestion):**
- Whole grains in intact form (steel-cut oats, quinoa, brown rice)
- Starchy vegetables (sweet potatoes, squash)
- Legumes (beans, lentils)
- Vegetables (all kinds)

**The fiber difference:** Fiber slows sugar absorption dramatically. Choose whole foods over processed.

### **Strategy 3: Timing matters**

**Best practices:**
- Don't eat only carbs (always add protein/fat)
- Avoid eating large amounts of sugar on an empty stomach
- Eat regular meals to prevent crashes that trigger cravings
- Consider smaller, more frequent meals if you're prone to crashes

**For meditation:**
- Don't meditate on empty stomach (low blood sugar affects focus)
- Don't meditate immediately after large meals (blood goes to digestion)
- Best: light meal 1-2 hours before meditation

### **Strategy 4: Hydration**

Dehydration mimics low blood sugar:
- Causes fatigue, difficulty concentrating
- Triggers cortisol release
- Makes you crave sugar for energy

**Solution:** Drink water consistently throughout the day. Often what feels like sugar craving is actually thirst.

### **Strategy 5: Mindful sugar reduction (not elimination)**

**Gradual approach works better:**

**Week 1-2:** Eliminate obvious sources (soda, candy, desserts)  
**Week 3-4:** Read labels, reduce hidden sugars  
**Week 5-6:** Replace refined carbs with complex carbs  
**Week 7-8:** Fine-tune based on your body's responses

**Not:** Cold turkey elimination (often triggers binging)

**Sustainable approach:**
- 80/20 rule: Eat low-sugar 80% of the time
- Allow occasional treats mindfully
- Focus on adding nourishing foods, not just restricting
- Notice how you feel, let that motivate you

### **Strategy 6: Natural sweetness**

When you want sweetness:

**Better options:**
- Whole fruit (fiber slows absorption)
- Dates (natural, with fiber)
- Small amounts of dark chocolate (70%+ cacao)
- Cinnamon (sweetens without sugar)
- Vanilla extract

**Avoid:**
- Artificial sweeteners (still trigger insulin response, maintain sweet tooth)
- "Natural" sweeteners in large amounts (agave, honey, maple syrup—still sugar)

### **Strategy 7: Support gut health**

Remember the gut-brain axis:

**To support healthy gut bacteria:**
- Probiotic foods: yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, kimchi
- Prebiotic foods: garlic, onions, asparagus, bananas
- Fiber from vegetables and whole grains
- Reduce antibiotics when possible
- Manage stress (affects gut bacteria)

**Healthy gut → better neurotransmitter production → easier mindfulness**

## The withdrawal phase: What to expect

When you reduce sugar significantly, your body and mind will protest. Knowing what to expect helps:

### **Days 1-3: The worst**

**Physical symptoms:**
- Headaches
- Fatigue
- Irritability
- Strong cravings
- Possible nausea

**Mental/emotional symptoms:**
- Anxiety
- Depression
- Brain fog
- Obsessive food thoughts
- Poor meditation quality (temporarily)

**Why:** Your brain is recalibrating dopamine receptors and adjusting to stable blood sugar. It's literally withdrawal.

**What helps:**
- Stay hydrated
- Eat enough (this isn't about calorie restriction)
- Get extra sleep
- Be gentle with yourself
- Light exercise (walking)
- Tell people you might be grumpy

### **Days 4-7: Turning point**

**What happens:**
- Cravings start to diminish
- Energy begins to stabilize
- Mental clarity increases
- Mood evens out
- Meditation becomes easier

**Critical moment:** Don't give up before this shift happens. Most people quit during days 1-3.

### **Weeks 2-4: Adaptation**

**Changes you'll notice:**
- Sustained energy without crashes
- Clearer thinking
- Better emotional regulation
- Deeper meditation
- Less reactive
- Food freedom (you're not constantly thinking about eating)

**Your taste buds change:** Foods that didn't taste sweet now do. Sugar that once seemed normal now tastes too sweet.

### **Long-term (months):**

**Transformation:**
- Sugar has little hold on you
- You can occasionally indulge without triggering binge cycles
- Your baseline state is calm, clear, present
- Meditation deepens significantly
- Emotional stability feels normal, not effortful
- Natural dopamine sources (connection, nature, meditation) become genuinely rewarding

## Sugar and specific meditation challenges

Let's troubleshoot common meditation difficulties that are often sugar-related:

### **"My mind races uncontrollably"**

**Consider:** What did you eat in the last 2-3 hours?

**If high-sugar:**
- Your blood sugar spike is causing mental hyperactivity
- Wait it out, breathe through it
- Learn from this: eat differently before meditation

**Solution:** Protein/fat-based snack 1-2 hours before practice

### **"I get extremely sleepy when I meditate"**

**Consider:** Could be post-sugar crash, or chronic fatigue from blood sugar instability

**Investigation:**
- Track your food and energy levels
- Notice if sleepiness correlates with meal timing
- Check if you're experiencing reactive hypoglycemia

**Solution:** Stabilize blood sugar throughout the day, not just before meditation

### **"I can't sit still—my body is restless"**

**Consider:** Physical agitation often follows sugar consumption

**Sugar creates:**
- Nervous energy (not true vitality)
- Physical jitteriness
- Digestive discomfort

**Solution:** Try body-scan meditation to work with restlessness, and adjust diet

### **"I'm extremely irritable during meditation"**

**Consider:** Low blood sugar or sugar crash

**When blood sugar drops:**
- Brain perceives emergency
- Stress hormones flood system
- Everything irritates you

**Solution:** Small balanced snack before practice; stabilize eating patterns

### **"I get intrusive food thoughts"**

**This is the most obvious one:**
- Cravings hijacking attention
- Blood sugar instability creating urgency around food
- Dopamine-seeking behavior

**Solution:** Address blood sugar stability; cravings will diminish dramatically

## The meditation practice for working with sugar cravings

When a craving hits, you can use it as a mindfulness practice:

### **The RAIN practice for cravings**

**R - Recognize**
- "A craving is present"
- Name it without judgment
- Notice the urgency and intensity

**A - Allow**
- Let the craving be here
- Don't fight it or give in to it
- Just let it exist in your awareness

**I - Investigate**
- Where do you feel this in your body? (mouth? stomach? chest?)
- What's the quality of the sensation? (tight? empty? pulling?)
- What emotions accompany it? (anxiety? boredom? stress?)
- What thoughts arise? ("I need this." "I deserve this." "Just this once.")

**N - Nurture**
- Place a hand on your heart
- Speak kindly to yourself: "This is hard. Cravings are uncomfortable. I'm doing my best."
- Ask: "What do I really need right now?" (Often not sugar: rest, connection, comfort, stress relief)

### **The urge surfing practice**

Cravings are like waves—they build, peak, and subside.

**The practice:**
1. **Notice the craving** beginning
2. **Observe its intensity** on a scale of 1-10
3. **Watch it build** (don't act on it, just observe)
4. **Notice the peak** (maximum intensity)
5. **Watch it begin to subside** (it will, usually within 15-20 minutes)
6. **Observe the aftermath** (it passed, and you're okay)

**Key insight:** Cravings always pass. You don't have to act on them. They're temporary weather, not commands.

### **The substitution practice**

When you want sugar, ask: "What am I actually craving?"

**Often, it's not sugar but:**
- **Energy:** Take a walk, do stretches, get sunlight
- **Comfort:** Warm tea, cozy blanket, call a friend
- **Stimulation:** Engage your mind differently—read, create, move
- **Reward:** You've worked hard; find a non-food reward
- **Relief from boredom:** The real issue; sugar is just accessible

**Mindfulness reveals:** We often use sugar to meet needs it can't actually satisfy.

---

## The social dimension: Navigating sugar culture mindfully

Our culture is saturated with sugar. How do you navigate this while maintaining awareness?

### **Social situations**

**Challenges:**
- Celebrations centered on cake and sweets
- Peer pressure to partake
- "Just this once" becoming "every social occasion"
- Feeling like you're not participating

**Mindful approaches:**

**Option 1: Participate mindfully**
- Have a small portion
- Eat slowly, savoring
- Notice the experience fully
- Don't follow up with more

**Option 2: Decline gracefully**
- "I'm good, thank you!"
- "I've already had something sweet today"
- No need to explain or justify

**Option 3: Bring alternatives**
- Offer to bring fruit platter, veggie tray
- Make a naturally sweetened dessert
- Ensure there's something you can eat

**Key:** Don't make it a big deal. Your choice doesn't require others' approval.

### **Family and relationships**

**Challenges:**
- Different eating styles in same household
- Food as love language
- Resistance from family members
- Children and sugar

**Mindful approaches:**
- Communicate your intentions clearly
- Ask for support without demanding others change
- Cook meals that work for everyone
- Model relationship with food without preaching
- Allow others their choices

**For kids:** Restrict less, educate more. Forbidden fruit is most desirable. Teach awareness and body attunement.

### **Work environments**

**Challenges:**
- Break room full of donuts and candy
- Afternoon energy crashes leading to vending machine visits
- Coffee shop runs with sweetened beverages
- Celebrating everything with cake

**Mindful approaches:**
- Bring your own snacks (nuts, fruit, dark chocolate)
- Make your own coffee/tea
- Eat protein-rich lunch to prevent afternoon crashes
- Participate in celebrations without eating the cake (or have a small piece)

**Remember:** You don't owe anyone an explanation for what you eat or don't eat.

---

## The deeper practice: Beyond the physical

Ultimately, the relationship between sugar and mindfulness points to something deeper:

### **Sugar as a teacher**

Your sugar habits reveal:
- **How you relate to pleasure:** Are you able to experience it in moderation?
- **How you manage discomfort:** Do you reach for quick fixes?
- **Your relationship with control:** Are you rigid or flexible?
- **Self-compassion levels:** Do you shame yourself or stay curious?
- **Presence capacity:** Can you sit with what is, or do you need to alter states?

**Every craving is an opportunity** to practice awareness, to investigate what you're really seeking, to choose response over reaction.

### **The middle way**

Buddhism teaches the middle path—neither indulgence nor deprivation.

**With sugar, this means:**
- Not eating it compulsively or unconsciously
- Not making it forbidden (which increases its power)
- Noticing how it affects you
- Making informed choices
- Enjoying occasionally without guilt
- Releasing attachment to both having it and not having it

**The goal isn't perfection:** It's conscious choice, awareness of effects, and freedom from compulsion.

### **From external to internal sweetness**

As you stabilize blood sugar and deepen practice, something shifts:

**You discover:**
- Life has inherent sweetness that doesn't require added sugar
- Meditation itself becomes deeply satisfying
- Simple experiences bring genuine joy
- You don't need constant stimulation
- Presence is its own reward

**The ultimate teaching:** When you stop seeking external sweetness to fill an internal void, you discover the sweetness that was always there—in breath, in awareness, in simply being.

## Common questions and concerns

**Q: "Isn't fruit sugar bad too?"**

A: No. Whole fruit contains fiber, which slows absorption. It also contains vitamins, minerals, and phytonutrients. Fruit juice, however, is essentially sugar water—fiber removed. Eat fruit; don't drink it.

**Q: "What about natural sweeteners like honey or maple syrup?"**

A: They're still sugar. Slightly more nutrients than white sugar, but your body processes them similarly. Use sparingly if at all.

**Q: "Are artificial sweeteners okay?"**

A: Research is mixed. They don't spike blood sugar directly, but they may trigger insulin response, alter gut bacteria, and maintain your sweet tooth. For mindfulness purposes, they keep you attached to sweetness rather than freeing you from it.

**Q: "I meditate better after coffee with sugar. Doesn't that mean it helps?"**

A: Caffeine is providing the benefit, sugar is borrowing from tomorrow's energy. Try coffee with minimal sugar, or better yet, a protein-rich breakfast with coffee (no sugar) for sustained benefit.

**Q: "Isn't this just another diet/restriction/eating disorder?"**

A: It can be if approached from deprivation and control. This is about awareness and informed choice. If you have a history of disordered eating, work with a professional rather than self-implementing restriction.

**Q: "What if I fail and binge on sugar?"**

A: Then you practice self-compassion. Notice what happened, what triggered it, what you needed. Learn from it. Begin again. No shame, just data and renewed intention.

**Q: "Can I ever enjoy dessert again?"**

A: Absolutely. The goal isn't lifetime deprivation but conscious choice and freedom from compulsion. Occasional desserts enjoyed mindfully, without triggering binge cycles, are fine for most people.

---

## Closing: The sweet freedom

Here's the paradox: By understanding sugar's effects and making conscious choices around it, you gain freedom—both from sugar itself and from the unconscious patterns it reinforces.

You stop being controlled by cravings. You stop using food to manage emotions. You stop cycling between restriction and binge. You stop feeling guilty about what you ate.

Instead, you become:
- **Aware** of how food affects your mental state
- **Responsive** rather than reactive around sugar
- **Free** to choose based on genuine wisdom
- **Present** to your actual experience
- **Clear** in mind and stable in mood

Your meditation deepens. Your emotional regulation improves. Your energy stabilizes. The subtle joys of life become accessible again.

**This isn't about achieving perfect diet.** It's about removing obstacles to awareness, understanding cause and effect, and making choices that support the life you want to live—a life of presence, clarity, and freedom.

Sugar will always be there. Temptations will arise. But when you understand the relationship between what you eat and how you experience your mind, you're empowered to choose consciously.

**That choice—moment by moment—is mindfulness in action.**

What will you notice today about sugar and your state of mind? What experiment will you try? What might become possible if your system wasn't constantly managing blood sugar swings?

The answers wait in your direct experience. All you have to do is pay attention.

*"The food you eat can be either the safest and most powerful form of medicine or the slowest form of poison." — Ann Wigmore*

*May you eat with awareness. May you notice cause and effect. May you choose what supports clarity and presence. And may you discover the sweetness that exists independent of sugar—the sweetness of awareness itself.*

*Your body is your practice temple. Feed it wisely.*
