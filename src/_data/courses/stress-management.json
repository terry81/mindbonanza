        "teaching": "Stress isn't the enemy—chronic, unmanaged stress is. Today you'll learn to recognize your stress signals early, before overwhelm sets in.\n\n**The Stress Response**: When you perceive a threat, your body activates the stress response—heart rate increases, breathing quickens, muscles tense. This is useful for real danger but exhausting when triggered constantly by work emails, traffic, and worries.\n\n**Your Stress Signature**: Everyone experiences stress differently. Some feel it in their stomach, others in tight shoulders or a racing mind. Today you'll identify your personal stress signature.\n\n**Stress Triggers**: What activates your stress response? Deadlines? Conflict? Uncertainty? Being late? Awareness of triggers allows you to respond proactively.",

        "teaching": "If there's a stress response, there's also a relaxation response—and you can activate it on demand.\n\n**The Relaxation Response**: Discovered by Dr. Herbert Benson, this is your body's natural antidote to stress. Heart rate slows, breathing deepens, muscles relax. You activate it through breath, body awareness, and present-moment focus.\n\n**Diaphragmatic Breathing**: Most stressed people breathe shallowly from their chest. Deep belly breathing activates the vagus nerve, signaling safety to your nervous system.\n\n**Progressive Muscle Relaxation**: By deliberately tensing then releasing muscles, you trigger deep relaxation and become aware of where you hold tension.",

Today you'll learn to work with stress-inducing thoughts.\n\n**Stress Thoughts**: 'I can't handle this.' 'This is terrible.' 'I'm going to fail.' These thoughts amplify stress. The situation might be challenging, but the thought makes it unbearable.\n\n**Cognitive Defusion**: This technique creates distance from thoughts. Instead of 'I'm going to fail' (which feels like truth), you notice 'I'm having the thought that I'm going to fail' (which is just a thought).\n\n**Reframing**: Not toxic positivity, but realistic reappraisal. 'This is impossible' becomes 'This is challenging, and I've handled challenges before.' You're not denying difficulty—you're adding perspective.",
