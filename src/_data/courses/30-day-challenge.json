        "wisdom": "Much of our suffering comes from the stories we tell about our experience, not the experience itself.",

Instead of immediately shifting or stopping, first: notice it, breathe with it, investigate what it actually feels like. If it becomes too intense, adjust. But first, simply observe. 15 minutes.",

        "wisdom": "Emotions are energy moving through you. When you don't resist them, they flow and naturally change.",

        "wisdom": "Loving-kindness practice trains your mind toward warmth and connection—a beautiful complement to awareness practice.",

        "instructions": "Start with yourself (3 min): 'May I be safe, healthy, happy, at ease.' Then bring to mind someone you care about (3 min): 'May you be safe, healthy, happy, at ease.' Then a neutral person—someone you see regularly but don't know well (3 min). Then someone you find difficult (3 min—if this feels too hard, skip for now). Finally, extend to all beings (3 min): 'May all beings be safe, healthy, happy, at ease.'",
        "wisdom": "Loving-kindness isn't about forcing feelings. It's about intention—planting seeds of goodwill.",

        "wisdom": "At two weeks, many people hit a wall. Push through. The magic happens when you keep showing up after the novelty fades.",

      "content": {
        "intention": "Week 3: Exploration! Today, meditation in motion.",
        "instructions": "Find a space to walk slowly (even 10 feet back and forth works). Walk very slowly. Feel your foot lifting, moving, placing, weight shifting. If walking very slow feels silly, walk at a normal pace but pay close attention to the sensations of walking. Eyes can be open, soft gaze down. 15 minutes.",
        "wisdom": "Meditation doesn't require stillness. You can bring full awareness to any activity. Walking meditation bridges formal practice and daily life.",
        "reflection": "How was this different from sitting? Did you find your mind wandering more or less?"

When you find yourself thinking about sounds ('That's a car,' 'I don't like that noise'), return to just hearing. Pure sound without labeling. 15 minutes.",
        "wisdom": "Most of the time we filter sounds through preference. This practice trains pure perception—hearing without judgment.",
        "reflection": "How many layers of sound did you notice? Could you hear without immediately labeling?"

      "content": {
        "intention": "Today we use imagination as a meditation tool.",
        "instructions": "Close your eyes. Imagine a place where you feel completely safe and peaceful—maybe a beach, forest, mountain, or room. Build it in detail: What do you see? Hear? Smell? Feel? Spend 12 minutes in this place, making it vivid and returning here whenever your mind wanders.",
        "wisdom": "Visualization works because your mind doesn't fully distinguish between vivid imagination and reality. This triggers real relaxation.",
        "reflection": "Where did you go? How did your body respond to the visualization?"
      }
    },

        "intention": "Today we use a repeated phrase to focus the mind.",
        "instructions": "Choose a word or short phrase: 'peace,' 'let go,' 'I am here,' 'Om,' or anything meaningful to you. Repeat it silently in rhythm with your breath. When your mind wanders, return to the mantra. 15 minutes.",
        "wisdom": "Mantras work by giving your mind something to do. The repetition creates a groove for attention to rest in.",
        "reflection": "What mantra did you choose? Did the repetition become soothing or boring?"
      }

        "intention": "Today we cultivate appreciation—a powerful practice for well-being.",
        "instructions": "Sit quietly. Bring to mind things you're grateful for—big or small. Your health. A person. Your home. A tree outside. A memory. A meal. For each, pause and really feel the gratitude. Let it fill you. Spend 12 minutes in appreciation.",
        "wisdom": "Gratitude isn't toxic positivity—it's choosing to notice what's good alongside what's difficult. This rewires your brain toward positivity.",
        "reflection": "What came up? How did your body feel during this practice?"
      }

        "wisdom": "This advanced practice trains you to be present with whatever life brings—the essence of mindfulness.",
